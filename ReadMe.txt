The Tramway R Code has 3 folders
>scripts Folder - which has an old_scripts sub folder and a image_stacking sub folder
>output_data - which has the data frames with all extracted data for footprint exported to csv files and xcel files
>figures folder - which has a plots sub folder 

All scripts will overwrite pre existing data (plots, csv files, image data) when run.
